# Q_learning for inverting a pendulum
This repository contains the code necessary to simulate the dynamics of a pendulum, apply reinforcement learning (specifically Q-learning) to derive a control policy, and visualize the value function and policy for the control of an inverted pendulum system. The project is built using Python and utilizes libraries such as NumPy for numerical operations and Matplotlib for visualization.

## Dependencies
To run the simulation and training scripts, you will need:

Python 3.x
NumPy
Matplotlib
SciPy (optional, if advanced integrators are used)
You can install the required Python libraries with pip:

`pip install numpy matplotlib scipy`

## How to Run
To perform the training and simulation of the pendulum:

`python main.py`

## Visualization
To visualize the pendulum's behavior and the learning process, ensure you are running the scripts in an environment that supports HTML5 video rendering.
To run in VS Code, run the file using "Run Current File in interactive window" option.
